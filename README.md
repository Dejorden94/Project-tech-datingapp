# About Mole dating
Mole dating is a blind dating, the focus of this app is to match people on base of how they describe them self and what they are looking for in a partner. In the app you choose one picture that will determine your first impression. The user doesnâ€™t have to swipe to get matches. You will get according to your preferences.
